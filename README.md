- Get data(observation) from sensor 
- Data preprocess for training
- Optimize the policy network by Deep Reinforcement Learning
- Agent output action command for quadrotor depend on current policy network
- Controller transform the reference action into control signal for actuator  
- Quadrotor take action and get new data from sensor
